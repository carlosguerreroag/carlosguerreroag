## Hi there! I am Carlos 🙋‍♂️

I'm currently working as a SysAdmin | DevOps at Flumotion.

My journey is a continuous evolution of actively deepening my skills in cloud infrastructure, automation, scripting, and DevSecOps practices.
I strive to stay ahead of the curve, constantly learning, improving and seeking new challenges that allow me to develop both personally and professionally.

If you're interested in sharing ideas, projects, or opportunities in the Operations/Cybersecurity field, feel free to get in touch. 

Thank you for visiting my profile! 🙌
